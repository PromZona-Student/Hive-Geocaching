## How to open the .fig file and continue design?

Design is done with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). It is a collaborative interface design and prototyping tool.

To open the `.fig` file and continue design, follow these steps:

1. [Create an account to Figma](https://www.figma.com/signup).
2. Log in to Figma.
3. Open the `.fig` file in your Figma workspace.
4. Share view and edits rights to the Figma project for your team members so you can start collaborating.

The `.fig` file has three pages: "LATEST VERSIONS", "Frontpage" and "Map, Login, Credit and Cache info pages and Project poster". LATEST VERSIONS has the reviewed and accepted designs. The other pages contain the previous versions and work in progress versions of the pages. The free version of Figma had a limit of three pages which is the reason for grouping so many separate view and page designs on the third page.

## Unimplemented features

Some features have already been designed but the Tampere university software engineering project course did not have time to implement them in spring 2023. The biggest features that have their initial design ready in `.fig` file are:

- desktop version of frontpage
- desktop version of map page
- detailed cache information page.
