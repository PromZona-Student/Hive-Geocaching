# Geocache.fi mock backend

## Tech stack:

-   Language: Typescript
-   Framework: Express.js

## Instructions:

When a new endpoint for the api is needed, add it to an existing router or create a new one. If you add a new router, you need to use it in app.ts. See the existing router for an example.

## Installing dependencies:

You need node.js(v18) to run the mock backend.

To install dependencies, run

```
npm ci
```
inside the mock-backend directory.

## Running the mock backend

To run the mock backend, use the command

```
npm run dev
```

inside the mock-backend directory.

After changes are made to the backend, you need to re-run it for the changes to take effect.
